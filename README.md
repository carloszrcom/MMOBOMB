## üéØ Overview

This educational project demonstrates how to build a complete iOS application that fetches and displays a list of free-to-play games from the [MMOBomb API](https://www.mmobomb.com/api). The app showcases modern iOS development practices including:

- SwiftUI declarative UI framework
- Swift 6 concurrency with async/await
- SwiftData for local persistence
- Clean architecture principles
- Separation of concerns (DTOs, Models, Entities)
- MVVM-like pattern with Stores
- RESTful API integration

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This architecture is subject to change as the project evolves and incorporates new learning concepts and best practices.

## ‚ú® Features

- üì± **Game List**: Browse a comprehensive list of free-to-play games
- üîç **Search**: Real-time search by title, genre, platform, or developer
- üìñ **Game Details**: View detailed information including:
  - Game description
  - Screenshots gallery
  - System requirements
  - Publisher and developer info
  - Release date
- üíæ **Offline Mode**: Local caching with SwiftData (24-hour expiration)
- ‚Üª **Pull to Refresh**: Update data from the API
- üé® **Modern UI**: Clean, native iOS design following Apple's HIG
- ‚ö° **Performance**: Efficient image loading and data management

## Architecture

The project follows a **layered architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:


Presentation Layer
(Views, Stores, Components)

Domain Layer    
(Models, Entities)  

Data Layer     
(DTOs, Mappers, Repositories)

Core Layer          
(Network, Persistence, Utils)


### Current Architecture Pattern: MV with Stores

The app uses a **Model-View pattern with Stores** (similar to MVVM but leveraging SwiftUI's native capabilities):

- **Models**: Immutable structs representing business logic
- **Views**: SwiftUI views that render the UI
- **Stores**: `@Observable` objects managing state and presentation logic
- **Repositories**: Handle data fetching from API and local cache

**Why this pattern?**
- SwiftUI's declarative nature reduces the need for traditional ViewModels
- `@Observable` macro (Swift 6) provides automatic change tracking
- Stores are easily testable and maintainable
- Scalable for growing applications

> **Note:** As the project evolves, the architecture may transition to other patterns (e.g., The Composable Architecture, Redux-like, etc.) for educational purposes.
